# Flask arithmetic webapp
It is recommended to use the app in a virtualenv. For instructions on how to create and activate one please refer [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/).

Once you have a environment ready and activated please refer to the below steps.

1. Clone the folder to your local directory.
2. Navigate into the folder.
3. Install the dependencies for the project using: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
4. (Optional) if you are on a linux environtment I would recommend adding the "execution permission to the "web_server.py" by running <code>chmod + x ./web_server.py</code>
5. Start the webserver by: <br>
a.  For windows: <code>python web_server.py</code> <br>
b.  For Linux: <code>./web_server.py</code>(if you executed the optional 4th step) <br>
else: <code>python web_server.py</code>
